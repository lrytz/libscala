git tools
=========

Skewed toward scala development.  Cobbled together by paulp@improving.org.

You should read the source to see what they do, and
read git documentation if you're unsure.  Some of these
are dangerous.  Have backups.  Have them regardless.

You will be happiest if you have patchutils installed.

    # if you have homebrew...
    brew install patchutils

Usage

Assuming this is checked out into /r/gittools,
